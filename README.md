it is abinary classification example which classifies the movie review as good or bad reviews.
we have classified the movie reviews as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.
we took the IMDB dataset: a set of 50,000 highly polarized reviews from the Internet Movie Database. Theyâ€™re split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing, each set consisting of 50% negative and 50% positive reviews.

it involves following steps:
-> LOADING  THE DATASET
-> PREPARING THE DATA
-> BUILDING THE DENSE NETWORK
-> COMPILING AND CONFIGURING THE MODEL
